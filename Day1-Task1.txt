In 1989, HTTP was discovered by Tim Berners-Lee. HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & 
it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server 
and the server sends the response back to the user. For instance, browsing on website such as 
Google Chrome, Firefox, etc. HTTP 1.1 was its 1st standardized version that was available for 
use in the year 1997. But it has been observed that http 1.1 has many loopholes, poor response
time. Hence, to make it more efficient and reliable, HTTP 2 has came with efficiency, speed and 
security. 


                        DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 V/S HTTP 2


             HTTP 1.1                                            HTTP 2


a. HTTP 1.1 works on the textual format.          a. HTTP 2 works on the binary protocol.

b. HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the         b. HTTP 2 is able to use a single TCP 
   other, so if one resource cannot be               connection to send multiple streams of 
   loaded, it blocks all the other resources         data at once so that no resource blocks 
   behind it.                                        any other resources.

c. HTTP 1.1 uses request resource in-lining       c. To avoid a server receiving lots of 
   for use in getting multiple pages.                requests, HTTP 2 introduced a server push 
                                                     functionality. With that, the server tries 
                                                     to predict the resources that will be 
                                                     requested soon.

d. HTTP 1.1 compresses data by itself.            d. HTTP 2 uses a more advanced compression 
                                                     method called HPACK that eliminates 
                                                     unnecessary information in HTTP header 
                                                     packets.                                      

e. HTTP 1.1â€™s functionality is quite slower       e. HTTP 2 processes faster than HTTP 1.1.
   than compared to new version HTTP 2.
